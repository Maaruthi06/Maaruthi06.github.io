Kuvalaya: The International Union for Conservation of Nature uses several criteria to enter species in this category.
Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species' home. 
Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in captivity, an example being the military macaw.

There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable, compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222, respectively.
Practices such as Cryoconservation (Cryo-preservation or cryo-conservation is a process where organelles, cells, tissues, extracellular matrix, organs, or any other biological constructs susceptible to damage caused by unregulated chemical kinetics are preserved by cooling to very low temperatures[typically −80 °C using solid carbon dioxide or −196 °C using liquid nitrogen])  of animal genetic resources have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically.
There are more than 2000 species of fauna that can be found in Tamil Nadu. This rich wildlife is attributed to the diverse relief features as well as favorable climate and vegetation in the Indian state.
