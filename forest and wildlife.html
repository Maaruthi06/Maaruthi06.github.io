		<h2>FOREST </h2>  


		<p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use." Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.
		Forests are the predominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe. More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America). The largest share of forests (45 percent) are in the tropical latitudes, followed by those in the boreal, temperate, and subtropic domains.
		Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests.</p>




		<h2>TYPES OF FOREST</h2> 


		<p>Tropical, temperate, and boreal forests around the world play an important role in the earth’s ecosystem. Forests are land areas that contain many trees and they have their own ecosystem called a biome. It is estimated that forests cover about 30% of the earth’s total land area. These dense woodlands can include evergreen conifers, broad-leafed deciduous trees, or a mixture of these tree types.

		There are 3 main forest biomes:<br>
		• Tropical rainforests are found in South America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia.<br>
		• Temperate forests are generally found in North America, Europe, and East Asia.<br>
		• The Boreal forest is also called the taiga and stretches across the cold regions of northern Russia, Scandinavia, and Canada.<br></p>



		<h2>IMPORTANCE OF FOREST </h2>


		<p>Forest is the house to many living organisms. It is a precious resource provided by nature. The organisms living in forests are interdependent on each other. Life in forests is governed by factors like air, water and sunlight. There are a variety of plants available in most forests: herbs, shrubs and trees depending upon the climate of the region. Plants make their own food by the process of photosynthesis and animals depend on plants and other animals for their food. Sometimes plants also depend on animals for processes like pollination and seed dispersal. There are many forests spread over large areas across the globe. Forest can be classified as: tropical, evergreen, partly evergreen, deciduous and dry forests based on the climatic conditions and types of trees present. Forests also comprise non-living components such as lakes, ponds, soil, rocks, etc. A forest is defined as an area forming an ecosystem.</p>







		<h2>Conservation of forest</h2>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came in to force with effect from October 25, 1980. Under the provisions of this Act, prior approval of the Central Government is essential for diversion of forest lands for the non-forestry purposes. In the national interest and in the interest of future generations, this Act, therefore, regulates the diversion of forest lands to non forestry purposes. The basic objective of the Act is, to regulate the indiscriminate diversion of forest lands for non forestry uses and to maintain a logical balance between the developmental needs of the country and the conservation of natural heritage. The, guidelines have been issued under the Act from time to time, to simplify the procedures, to cut down delays and to make the Act more user friendly. To ensure this, recently, new rules under this Act have been framed and notified on 10/1/2003 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

		Diversion of forest land under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is required for many purposes such as Electric Transmission line, Hydel, Irrigation, Mining, Roads, Water supply etc. The concerned User Agencies are applying to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests directly for such diversion. After thorough scrutiny, the applications are processed and orders are obtained from the competent authorities for the diversion. Forest areas have been diverted in the State mainly for various Government projects.</p><br><br>


		<h2>Wildlife</h2>

		<h2>Vulnerable species</h2>

		<p><br>The International Union for Conservation of Nature uses several criteria to enter species in this category.
		Vulnerability is mainly caused by habitat loss or destruction of the species' home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in captivity, an example being the military macaw.<br><br>

		There are currently 5196 animals and 6789 plants classified as vulnerable, compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222, respectively.
		Practices such as Cryoconservation (Cryo-preservation or cryo-conservation is a process where organelles, cells, tissues, extracellular matrix, organs, or any other biological constructs susceptible to damage caused by unregulated chemical kinetics are preserved by cooling to very low temperatures[typically −80 °C using solid carbon dioxide or −196 °C using liquid nitrogen])  of animal genetic resources have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically.<br></p>

		<p id="birb">There are 8 vulnerable birds:<br>

		<br><span style="fonter;">1. Greater Spotted Eagle</span><br>

		<h2>Rare species of Tamil Nadu and Jamu & Kashmir</h2>


		<p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Tamil Nadu:</span> The southern birdwing, also called Sahyadri birdwing, is a large and striking swallowtail butterfly endemic to south India. With a wingspan of 140–190 mm, it is the second largest butterfly of India.a record an unknown specimen had held for 88 years.
 		<br><br>
		<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Jamu & Kashmir:</span>The Kashmir musk deer, which is one of seven similar species found throughout Asia, is endangered due to habitat loss and also because of poachers hunting the animal for its prized scent glands.This species was originally described as a subspecies to the alpine musk deer, but is now classified as a separate species. The deer stand at 60 cm (2.0 ft) tall.<br>

		<br>Other rare animals of <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Jamu & Kashmir:</span> are Tibetan Gazelle, Snow Leopard, Himalayan Tahr, White backed vulture and Western Tragopan. <br><br> And other rare animals of <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Tamil Nadu:</span> are tiger in Mudumalai National Park.
