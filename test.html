        <h2>Water</h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br>
        <p id="p1">Water harvesting is an age-old concept in India. Waterharvesting techniques are highly locale specific and the benefits are also localised. Giving people control over their local water resources ensures that mismanagement and over-exploitation of these resources is reduced/removed. <br> Watershed management emphasises scientific soil and water conservation in order to increase the biomass production. The aim is to develop primary resources of land and water, to produce secondary resources of plants and animals for use in a manner which will not cause ecological imbalance. Watershed management not only increases the production and income of the watershed community, but also mitigates droughts and floods and increases the life of the downstream dam and reservoirs.</p>

        <h2>Which state ranks first in rain water harvesting? </h2>
    
        <p>Tamil Nadu has been a trendsetter in rain water harvesting, making it mandatory for all buildings as far back as 2003. The project began in 2001 and has since been initiated in all of Tamil Nadu's rural areas. Rainwater harvesting is promoted through posters in Tamil Nadu, including rural areas. Tamil Nadu is the first state in India to make rooftop rainwater harvesting mandatory for all homes.<br>
        <b>How is water conserved in Tamil Nadu?</b>    
<br>
        The key achievements of the state government in water conservation and improvement areas include renovation of 6,278 water resources at a cost of Rs 1,433 crore through the Kudimaramath scheme, distribution of nutrient soil removed from these water bodies to 6.69 lakh farmers, allocation of Rs 1,000 crore constructing.</p>

<h2>How water is conserved in Jammu and Kashmir?</h2>
        <p id="p3">The prime water resources in this region are mountainous and have been tapped, utilized and conserved significantly through participation of farming community by means of this system. Kools are constructed from high elevation to low, between hills on plain land from a perennial source of water.                                                                             
<br>
        What is the need of conservation and management of water resources?
        Population, household size, and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change will increase pressures on natural water resources especially in industrial and agriculture. Better water conservation and management has economic benefits and helps protect the environment.
