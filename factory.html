		<h2>Fossil and fuels</h2>
		<p>The union territory has limited mineral and fossil fuel resources, much of which are concentrated in the Jammu region. Small reserves of natural gas are found near the city of Jammu, and bauxite and gypsum deposits occur in the vicinity of Udhampur. Other minerals include limestone, coal, zinc, and copper.<br></p>
		<h2>Main resource</h2>
		<p>As per the Department of Geology and Mining, a major part of the mineral wealth of Tamil Nadu is confined to Salem District, where a variety of important minerals like Magnesite, Dunite, Bauxite, Limestone, Iron ore, Quartz, Feldspar and Soapstone, Granites etc, are found.</p>



		<h2>Produced minerals</h2>
		<p>Jammu & Kashmir is the sole holder of country's borax and sapphire resources and possesses 36% graphite, 21% marble and 14% of gypsum. Coal, gypsum and limestone are the important minerals produced in the State</p>



		<h2>Use of resources</h2>
		<p>Jammu and Kashmir has a huge quantity of biomass by-products, which can be utilized for electricity generation by the use of solar energy, bio gas, gasification technologies, etc. The Ladakh region gets approximately 320 days of sunshine for a year and is one of the best places in the world for solar cooking.</p>
